# Clone Clicker
Daniel will write this JavaScript game.

The aim is to click a button to deal some amount of damage to an enemy on the screen.

Here is a bare bones version you can already test: http://static.3ice.hu/button-click-counter.htm

Each enemy defeated (hit points reduced to zero) yields gold, based on the enemy level.

The faster you click, the more enemies you defeat, the faster you can increase your power.

Gold can be spent on upgrades, bigger and better weapons, or hiring helpers to fight for you.
