Our first task is this:
```
General description of what you are doing and how you are doing that (what kinds of views, models are needed),
how they relate to each other, and what is the implementation order and timetable.

In the project plan your group will at least tell the following:
students in your group (names, email addresses, student ids)
name of your group
what of the listed features you plan to implement
are there some extra features not listed in the project description what you plan to implement?
for each feature, how you are going to implement it
information on how you plan on working on the project  (will you meet face-to-face regularly, will use some project management tools, etc.)

Keep your project plan updated during the project!
